        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 <em>bananas</em>, peeled (approx. 160g/5oz peeled weight)</li>
            <li>120g/4½oz <em>plain flour</em></li>
            <li>1 tsp <em>baking powder</em></li>
            <li>120ml/4¼fl oz <em>oat milk </em>(or other plant-based milk)</li>
            <li>3 tsp <em>coconut or vegetable oil</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>To serve (optional)</h3>
            <li>handful blueberries</li>
            <li>1 banana, sliced </li>
            <li>maple syrup (or honey if you're not vegan), to drizzle </li>
            <li>dollop coconut yoghurt</li>
        <h3>Coocking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Roughly chop the bananas and add to a blender with the flour, baking powder and oat milk. Blend until smooth. Alternatively, mash the banana thoroughly on a plate, then transfer to a bowl and whisk in the other ingredients until smooth. </li>
                <li>Heat a teaspoon of the oil in a small frying pan over a medium–high heat and spoon the mixture into the pan to make two pancakes, each about 10cm/4in in diameter – you will need about a tablespoon of mixture per pancake. Cook for around 2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown, adding more oil if needed, then keep warm. Repeat until you have made all the pancakes. </li>
                <li>To serve, divide the pancakes between two plates and top with the banana, blueberries, maple syrup and coconut yoghurt. Enjoy while still warm. </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <li>Try adding other flavours to the batter. A pinch of cinnamon or a dash of vanilla extract are delicious, or a spoon of nut butter adds extra protein.</li>
        <li>These pancakes are also vegan, but honey isn't so stick with maple syrup as a topping.</li>
