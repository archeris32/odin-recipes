            <ul>
                <li>4 x 150g/5½oz centre cut <em>fillet steaks</em></li>
                <li>50g/1¾oz <em>butter</em>, at room temperature</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground <em>black pepper</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>For the sauce</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>100ml/3½fl oz <em>beef stock</em></li>
                <li>½ <em>garlic clove,</em> crushed</li>
                <li>2 tbsp <em>brandy</em></li>
                <li>1 tbsp <em>Worcestershire sauce</em></li>
                <li>1 tbsp <em>Dijon mustard</em></li>
                <li>150ml/¼ pint <em>double cream</em></li>
                <li>½ tsp crushed <em>black peppercorns</em></li>
                <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh <em>parsley</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Cooking</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Using your hands, flatten the steaks to a thickness of about 1½cm/¾in. Season them well with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a large frying pan or griddle pan over a high heat until very hot. Spread the butter directly onto the steak and fry for 2 minutes on each side. Cover loosely with foil, rest and keep warm.</li>
            <li>For the sauce, add the stock to a saucepan, bring to the boil and cook until reduced by half. Add the garlic, brandy, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, cream and peppercorns. Stir and bring to the boil over a high heat. Season with salt and cook until it reaches the consistency of pouring cream. Stir in the parsley. </li>
            <li>Divide the steaks between plates, pour over the sauce and serve. </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Recipe Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The sauce can be made up to a day ahead, covered and kept in the fridge. You can just cook two fillet steaks and halve the sauce recipe for a special dinner for two.</li>
            <li>The steaks can be cooked in advance and reheated just before serving. Once cool, cover and keep in the fridge for up to 12 hours. Reheat on a baking tray with a knob of butter on top in an oven at 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 for 6 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
